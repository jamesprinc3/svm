# Alternate SVM Techniques

This work was undertaken during the summer after 2nd year. I provide two alternate implementations of space vector modulation (SVM) which is used to convert a 3 phase voltage into activations for transistor pairs in a PMSM motor.

Context for the DSVM implementation can be found in DSVM.pdf, the paper on which I based my implementation.

Running the makefile will compile the implementations and run all of the tests using the Unity testing framework
